# The plugin automatically adds a prefix with its name to all messages that the sender command sender receives.
# Messages sent to the trolled player and server-wide broadcasts or announcements do NOT contain the prefix.
# The prefix is currently hard coded.
# The prefix includes a certain styling for the message.
# The colours and format may be overridden by editing the string.

# Keeping the Updater enabled is recommended.
# Only disable if the server is not connected to the internet.
# Please keep in mind that disabling this may cause you to miss critical fixes.
